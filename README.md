## Contributing / Feedback

I'm a self‑taught software engineer using AI‑assisted tooling plus manual proofs.  
If you're comfortable with differential geometry, hyperbolic embeddings, or LLM memory,
I'd love a sanity check or collaboration. Open an issue or email me (address in
`author:` field of the papers).
