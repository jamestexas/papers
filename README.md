## Contents

### CHEESE: Contextual Hierarchy for Embedding Enhancement and Semantic Enrichment

[Paper](./cheese/paper.md) | [Code](./cheese/cheese_minimal.py)

Biologically-inspired memory management system for LLMs with contextual fabric approach.


### BREAD: Bundles, Relations, Embeddings, And Dimensions

[Paper](./bread/paper.md) | [Code](./bread/bread_minimal.py)

Hyperbolic embeddings and fiber bundle architecture for hierarchical knowledge representation.
<!---
Includes:
- Emergent Stratification patterns
- SLICE/LOAF measurement framework
-->

### SMoGE: Structured Multi-Geometric Expertise

[Paper](./smoge/smoge_paper.pdf) | [Code](./smoge/)

Multi-geometric representation system using Euclidean, hyperbolic, and tropical geometries simultaneously.

### L-Shape: Lossless Hierarchical Representation using harmonic packing principles
[Paper](./lshape/lshape_paper.pdf) | [Code](./lshape/)

Compression technique that improves semantic relationships through geometric separation.

### Thermodynamic Analysis of Semantic Information (patent pending)
<!---
[Paper](./thermodynamics/thermodynamics_paper.pdf) | [Code](./thermodynamics/)
-->
Discovery that semantic information exhibits measurable thermodynamic properties including "mass", entropy, and phase states (gas/liquid/solid). Demonstrates positive correlation between CPU processing time and semantic entropy, enabling computational cost prediction and phase-aware processing.

### Physical Properties of Semantic Information (patent pending)
<!---
[Paper](./physical_properties/physical_properties_paper.pdf) | [Code](./physical_properties/)
-->
Method for measuring intrinsic physical properties of semantic information in language models. Identifies measurable forces and curvature in embedding spaces that explain computational phenomena and enable prediction of processing failures before they occur.
