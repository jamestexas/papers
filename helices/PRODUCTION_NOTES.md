# Production Implementation Notes

For real-world deployment of the semantic uncertainty detector:

## 1. Tokenization
- Replace word-level segmentation with model-native tokenization
- Use `model.tokenizer.encode()` for consistent sub-word units
- Maintain alignment between tokens and embeddings

## 2. Performance Optimization
- Batch embed operations (see `prove_hyperbolic_geometry.py` for example)
- Cache hyperbolic distance calculations for repeated tokens
- Consider GPU kernels for distance matrix computation
- Use sparse representations for long sequences

## 3. Hyperbolic Distance Computation
- Current implementation uses Poincaré ball model
- For numerical stability near boundary, consider:
  - Klein model for certain operations
  - Lorentz model for very high dimensions
- Pre-normalize embeddings to avoid repeated computation

## 4. Threshold Tuning
- Current thresholds (0.5, 0.7, 3.0) are illustrative
- Tune on domain-specific validation sets
- Consider adaptive thresholds based on text length

## 5. Pattern Detection Extensions
- Add fine-grained patterns beyond the 4 basic types
- Implement confidence scores for pattern classification
- Consider ensemble methods for robustness

## 6. Integration Considerations
- For LLM routing: implement as preprocessing filter
- For uncertainty quantification: combine with token-level probabilities
- For real-time systems: maintain sliding window of embeddings

## Example Production Pipeline
```python
# Efficient batched processing
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokens = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')
embeddings = model.encode(tokens, batch_size=512)

# Cached distance computation
@lru_cache(maxsize=10000)
def cached_hyperbolic_distance(x_hash, y_hash):
    return hyperbolic_distance(x, y)
```

## Validation
See experimental validation in paper for expected performance characteristics:
- Counting tasks: ~10,000× deviation
- Normal text: <2× deviation
- Complex reasoning: 10-100× deviation
